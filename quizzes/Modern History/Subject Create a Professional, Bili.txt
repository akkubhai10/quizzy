Subject: Create a Professional, Bilingual Single-File HTML5 Quiz Application with Early-Exit Logic.

Context: Build a high-end, interactive web-based quiz application using only one file (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The design should be modern, minimalist, and feature a Glassmorphism aesthetic.

Data to use: [all question extract from given file, photos, etc. ]



Technical Requirements & Micro-Details:

 * Visual Design (Glassmorphism):

   * Background: A vibrant multi-color mesh gradient (e.g., Purple, Blue, and Pink).

   * The Card: A semi-transparent white container (rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)) with a strong backdrop-filter: blur(20px), rounded corners (25px), and a thin white border.

   * Typography: Use 'Poppins' from Google Fonts. Question text should be bold; English text in White, Hindi text in a slightly dimmed color (like #ddd).

 * Bilingual Support must (English + Hindi):

101-178 question must be included and same no change in any question.

   * Every question and every option must be displayed in both languages simultaneously.

   * Format: Top line English, Bottom line Hindi (smaller font size for Hindi to maintain hierarchy).

 * Start Screen & Custom Settings:

   * An input field for Manual Timer (seconds per question). Logic: If 0 or empty, timer is hidden/disabled.

   * A Shuffle Toggle to randomize the question order.

   * A "Start Quiz" button with a hover scale effect.

 * Quiz UI & Interactions:

   * Progress Bar: A thin, glowing bar at the very top that fills as the user progresses.

   * Question Counter & Score: Displayed at the top corners (e.g., "Question 05/20" and "Score: 04").

   * Timer Display: A circular or icon-based countdown. Crucial: Text must turn Pulse Red when time is < 5 seconds.

   * The "Submit Quiz" Button: Place a "Finish & Show Results" button at the bottom. Clicking this must immediately stop the quiz and show the results based on questions answered so far.

 * Feedback System (No External Files):

   * On Click: Disable all other option buttons immediately to prevent multiple clicks.

   * If Correct: Button turns Green. Trigger a Confetti/Flower fall animation using CSS/JS that covers the screen (Ensure z-index: 9999). Play a synthesized "Ting" sound using Web Audio API.

   * If Wrong: Selected button turns Red, Correct button turns Green. Display a large Sad Emoji (😢) in the center with a "shake" animation. Play a synthesized "Buzz" sound.

   * Auto-Transition: Automatically move to the next question after a 1.5-second delay.

 * Result Screen:

   * Display the final score prominently.

   * Dynamic Message: * 80%+ : "🏆 Outstanding Performance!"

     * 50-79% : "👏 Well Done! Keep it up."

     * Below 50%: "📚 Practice makes perfect! Try again."

   * A "Restart Quiz" button that resets all states.

 * Coding Constraints:

   * Mobile Responsive: Buttons must be easy to tap on mobile; text should not overflow.

   * Pure JS: No jQuery or external libraries.

   * Web Audio API: Synthesize sounds using OscillatorNode (no .mp3 dependencies).
